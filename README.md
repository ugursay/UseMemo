React App with useMemo Hook
This React application demonstrates how to use the useMemo hook to optimize performance when dealing with slow functions. It allows the user to enter a number, toggle between dark and light themes, and displays the doubled value of the number using a memoized function.

Features
Number Input: Enter a number to double it.
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes.
Memoized Function: The doubling function (slowFunc) is optimized using useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations.
Installation
To get started with this app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd your-repo-name
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Usage
Enter a number into the input field.
The doubled number will be displayed below.
Toggle between dark and light themes using the button.
Key Concepts
useState: Used to manage the state of the number and the theme.
useMemo: Optimizes performance by memoizing the result of the slowFunc, ensuring it only recalculates when the number changes.
Theme Styling: The background and text color change based on the value of dark.
